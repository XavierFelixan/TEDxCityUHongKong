                        </div>
                        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, <span className="text-red font-bold">TEDx</span> is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span>-like experience. At a <span className="text-red font-bold">TEDx</span> event, <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded <span className="text-red font-bold">TEDx</span>, where <span className="text-red font-bold">x</span> = independently organized <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> event. The <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> Conference provides general guidance for the <span className="text-red font-bold">TEDx</span> program, but individual <span className="text-red font-bold">TEDx</span> events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

                            <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> is on a mission to discover and spread ideas that spark imagination, embrace possibility and catalyze impact. Our organization is devoted to curiosity, reason, wonder and the pursuit of knowledge â€” without an agenda. We welcome people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world and connection with others, and we invite everyone to engage with ideas and activate them in your community.
                            <span className="text-red font-bold"> TED</span> began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, but today it spans a multitude of worldwide communities and initiatives exploring everything from science and business to education, arts and global issues. In addition to the hundreds of <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> Talks curated from our annual conferences and published on <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span>.com, we produce original podcasts, short video series, animated educational lessons (<span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span>-Ed) and TV programs that are translated into more than 100 languages and distributed via partnerships around the world. Each year, more than 3,000 independently run <span className="text-red font-bold">TEDx</span> events bring people together to share ideas and bridge divides in communities on every continent. Through the Audacious Project, <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> has helped catalyze more than $3 billion in funding for projects that seek to make the world more beautiful, sustainable and just. In 2020, <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> launched Countdown, an initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis and mobilize a movement for a net-zero future. View a full list of <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> many programs and initiatives.
                            <span className="text-red font-bold">TED</span> is owned by a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation. Our aim is to help create a future worth pursuing for all.
